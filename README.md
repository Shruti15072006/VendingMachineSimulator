Vending Machine Simulation in C

VendoC is a console-based vending machine simulation built in C. It allows users to view products, select multiple items, calculate total price, and simulate payment using a QR code system. This project was developed as a first-semester computer science project to practice arrays, structures, loops, and conditional logic.
